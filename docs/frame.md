# Frame control


You can use blender [driver system](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/drivers/index.html) to control the frame of the sequence.

## Default settings

Each sequence has its own property `Current Frame` to control its frame. By default, the value equals to the [blender current frame](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/timeline.html#frame-controls).
