Frame control
=============

You can use Blenders `driver system <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/drivers/index.html>`_ to control the frame of the sequence.

Default settings
*****************

Each sequence has its own property ``Current Frame`` to control its frame. By default, the value equals to the `blender current frame <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/timeline.html#frame-controls>`_.
